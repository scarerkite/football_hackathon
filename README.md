## 24 hr Hackathon

This was a project I undertook as part of the General Assembly Web Development Immersive Course. I worked in a team of 3, and we had to create any kind of app in 24hrs either alone, or as a team.

We created a World Cup themed pub finder app. The idea behind it is that you want to experience international matches surrounded by people whose team are playing, in their 'local' pub. 

We pulled in data about people's nationalities from the government database, and then used that to find the greatest concentration of nationalities in areas of London. We access the Yelp API to find the best sports bar in that area, and then display the address and location using the Google Maps API. For directions, we provide a Citymapper link with the destination already added.

### My role

The main areas I worked on:

* Scaffolded the app (including database)
* Researched how to use CSV files in Rails
* Created a custom rake task to upload the CSV file
* Added the Citymapper link and geocoding to get the coordinates needed to use it
